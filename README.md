# DPM_scraper_2

## About

This code was taken from the initial repository called Venmo_scraper written by Mohit, but changed up a little bit so the output prints in a pretty manner in the console, rather than sending it to the secretary. It shows all the current DPMs, how much they've paid, and also money made from dues this semester/this year.

## How to use

To run this script, first make sure that you have python installed. If you don't have python installed, click [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Once you have python installed, open a terminal. 

### Prerequisites to cloning a repository
To clone a repository, you must have git installed which also requires pip to be installed. Pip usually works once you have python installed, but if you don't have pip, look [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/). Then, type `pip install git` and press "enter" to install git. Once this is done and no errors occur, move on to the next step.

### Cloning this repository.
Once you have all things installed, go onto your desktop and make a new folder. For macs, literally go to your desktop and click "new folder" and make one. Call it "DPMScraper." Then, click on the folder and COPY it to your clipboard. Then, go to the terminal and go to that folder. To do this, type "cd" then click CMD+V - this should then paste a filepath to the folder. It might look something like this: `cd /Users/charlie/Desktop/DPMScraper`. Click enter to move into that directory. Then, go to this repository and clone it by typing `git clone https://github.com/IROATUVA/DPM_scraper_2.git`. You have now moved the files to that local repository. Congrats!!

### Running the script
Once you have the repository cloned onto your local device, run the python script. You can do this by simply typing `python myscraper.py` or `python3 myscraper.py`, or just run it using whatever flavor of IDE you have installed. (If you want to open a folder in vscode from the terminal, just type `code .`). Then, google will prompt you to log in to an account - log in to treasurer@iroatuva.org. The script will run, and you'll see the output in the console!
